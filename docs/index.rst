   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Laika
=====

*laika* is a business reporting library that allows you to request data
from different sources and send it to someone or save it at some
destination. For example: you can query your database, send the result
as an excel attachment via email and save it on Google Drive or Amazon
S3.

Check out the documentation at `readthedocs <http://laika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_.

.. TODO: document what it is and what it is not

Laika was tested on Python 2.7 and 3.5 or higher.

Installation
------------

You can install it directly using `pip`:


.. code:: bash

    $ pip install laika-lib

You can specify extra dependencies. To find out what dependencies you need to install, check out configuration docs. For example, to install libraries to use Google Drive and Amazon S3 in your reports you must run:


.. code:: bash

    $ pip install laika-lib[drive, s3]

Usage
-----

``laika.py`` is a script that lets you use laika library. You can run it
like this:

.. code:: bash

    $ laika.py some_report

This command will run the report named *some\_report*. This report must
be defined in some configuration file. By default laika looks for
``config.json`` in the same directory. You can specify a custom config
passing ``-c`` parameter:

.. code:: bash

    $ laika.py -c my_config.json

Path to configuration file can also be specified with the
``LAIKA_CONFIG_FILE_PATH`` environment variable:

.. code:: bash

    $ export LAIKA_CONFIG_FILE_PATH='/home/me/my_config.json'
    $ laika.py my_report

Another parameter you can use is ``--pwd`` which serves for specifying
working directory. It can also be specified in configuration file or
``LAIKA_PWD`` environment variable.

Arguments
~~~~~~~~~

You can check all the predefined ``laika.py`` arguments with ``--help``.

Undefined arguments will be added to report's definition overwriting
default values. Thus, if for example the configuration for ``my_report``
defines field ``my_field`` with value ``foo``, if you execute it like
this:

.. code:: bash

    $ laika.py my_report --my_field bar

``my_field`` configuration will contain ``bar`` as value.

You can also overwrite :ref:`global-configuration` via command line arguments.


Testing
-------

To run test, you must install test dependencies:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install laika-lib[test]

Then, run test from laika directory:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd path/to/laika
    $ python -m unittest discover
